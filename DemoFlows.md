TrackPH Demo Guide
The 5 best flows to show when explaining the app
January 29, 2026

Goal of the demo
In a few minutes, you want people to understand three things:
TrackPH helps anyone find an athlete and see real results.
TrackPH shows clear national rankings (#1, #2, #3) that people can trust.
TrackPH connects athletes, clubs, competitions, and Philippine Athletics in one place.

What is TrackPH?
TrackPH is a website for Philippine track and field. It helps people find athletes, see meet results, and see who is ranked #1, #2, #3 in each event.

The 5 main parts of the app
Think of the app like 5 big pages that all connect:
Athletes: each athlete has a profile page.
Rankings: a list of the best athletes in each event.
Clubs: each club has a page with its roster and coaches.
Competitions: meet calendar and meet results.
Recognition: shows what is official and trusted (for safety and rules).

Two words you will hear a lot
Personal Best (PB): the best time/distance the athlete has ever done.
Ranking: where the athlete stands compared to others (example: #3 in the Philippines).

Who uses TrackPH?
Fans and families who want to follow an athlete.
Athletes who want a clean page to share (for coaches, schools, sponsors).
Coaches and clubs who want to show their athletes and track progress.
Journalists and content creators who need fast, accurate stats.
Sponsors who want to support real athletes and real clubs.
Philippine Athletics staff who need a clear, official system.

How it all works (one connected system)
This is the simple loop:
Competitions produce results.
Results update athlete profiles.
Athlete profiles create rankings.
Athletes belong to clubs (so clubs and athletes link to each other).
Philippine Athletics can recognize what is official and safe.

How the 5 flows connect
Different people start in different places. But everything connects through the athlete profile.

Athlete Profiles are the center. Rankings, Clubs, and Competitions all link back to them.

Simple way to say it out loud during the demo:
A meet happens → results are posted.
Results update athlete pages.
Athlete pages create rankings.
Athletes belong to clubs, so clubs and athletes connect.
Philippine Athletics can mark what is official and safe.

If you only have a little time
5 minutes: Show Flow 1 (Athlete) + Flow 2 (Rankings).
10 minutes: Add Flow 3 (Clubs).
15 minutes: Add Flow 4 (Competitions) + Flow 5 (Recognition).

One sentence closer
TrackPH is the one place where you can find Philippine track athletes, see official results, and see national rankings—so athletes, clubs, fans, and Philippine Athletics are all looking at the same truth.
