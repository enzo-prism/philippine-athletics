Updated: 2026-02-26

## Goal
Show local discovery, athlete pathway visibility, and safe-sport confidence for LGU stakeholders.

## Route Script
1. Open `/demo/lgus`.
2. Explore `/clubs` and open one club profile.
3. Move to athlete roster links and confirm profile consistency.
4. Open `/recognition` and highlight safe-sport and trust signals.
5. Return to `/search` and run one membership-number query.

## Proof Points
- Local club-to-athlete navigation is direct.
- Recognition and safety context are visible.
- Demo remains tightly controlled and presentation-safe.
